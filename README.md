## Overview

Claude Shannon's seminal masters thesis is considered by
many to be the most important masters thesis of the 20th century.

Shannon's thesis laid the foundation for the digital revolution by
showing how to reason about electromechanical relay circuits using
boolean algebra and propositional logic.

Shannon's thesis contains many theorems and assertions -- most of
which are not proven.  This paper sets out to prove many of those
theorems and assertions.
